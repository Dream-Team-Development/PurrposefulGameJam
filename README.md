# Purrty Time - Purrposeful Game Jam

This is the submission for the Cats Protection x Tentacle Zone game jam focussed on spreading awareness on the welfare of cats. This game is based on the theme "The De-chonking".

This is a two-player split-screen game (Player 1 using the WASD keys and Player 2 using the arrow keys), in which the players must compete in maintaining their cat's healthy weight - whoever stays the closest wins!

This game is made up of two levels - the first an eating game where players can eat food off of a conveyor belt but must make sure they eat the right things so your cat doesn't get sick! Player 1 can use the E key, and Player 2 use the right ctrl key to eat. The second level is a rhythm dance game where the player must make sure they hit the right keys at the right time to ensure their weight stays the same - hit too early or too late then you lose too much weight!
